⭐ TOP UNIQUE FEATURES TO ADD IN YOUR APP (FULL ARCHITECTURE & PROMPT)
🔥 Feature #1 — Self-Destructing Everything
🔹 Core Logic Requirements
Every message object contains:
- message_id
- sender_id
- receiver_id
- content
- message_type (text/audio/call/story)
- auto_delete_time (timestamp)
- viewed: boolean
- view_timestamp

Server cron checks:
IF viewed == true AND (CURRENT_TIME > view_timestamp + auto_delete_time) 
→ delete message permanently from DB + cloud.

🔹 Self-Deleting Audio Flow
User plays audio → backend records play_timestamp 
→ start deletion countdown
→ delete file URL from storage after X seconds

🔹 Call “Zero Logs”
VoIP call init record:
call_session_id
peer_ids
start_time
end_time

Server: delete record after call disconnect event
(No history saved)

🔹 Screenshot Detection Logic (Mobile)

Android + iOS listeners:

onScreenshot → trigger:
alert sender
block saving media
log breach

🔥 Scalability

Uses:
✔ real-time Firebase Firestore OR MongoDB Change Streams
✔ message queue deletion with RabbitMQ
✔ cleanup workers with CRON

Visual Flow

📌 Message → Open → Timer overlay
⏳ disappears
🔥 smooth fade-out animation

🟣 Feature #2 — Ghost Mode Chat (hidden private room)
🔹 Ghost Mode Activation

Gestures:

long press app logo

3-finger swipe

shake device

enter secret numeric code

if (gesture_detected + biometric_valid):
   redirect → /ghost-chat-room

🔹 Ghost Chat Visibility Rules
NOT shown in recent chats
NOT indexed
NOT searchable
NOT logged
Hidden messages table
Encrypted DB collection

🔹 Security Logic
Require PIN every entry
Require fingerprint every message view
Time-out auto lock if idle > 30 sec

🔹 Architecture

Create separate table:

GhostChat {
   ghost_message_id
   encrypted_payload
   session_encryption_key
   expire_at
}

🔹 Prevent OS exposure

no screenshot

no screen record

blur UI when switching app

remove task preview image

Visualization

Dark neon theme

Matrix-style typing animation

Floating encrypted symbols

Minimal UI activated like a secret mode

⚡ Replit Full Prompt (copy paste)
Add 2 ultra privacy features in my app:
1. Full Self-Destructing Communication System
2. Ghost Mode Hidden Chat System

Implementation rules:
- All messages, voice notes, calls and stories must auto delete permanently
- Include screenshot prevention, screen-record blocking and deletion timers
- Store messages in encrypted form until deleted
- Ghost chat must open on secret gesture and be hidden from normal UI

Database logic:
Create message object with:
{
 message_id,
 content,
 message_type,
 auto_delete_timer,
 viewed,
 timestamps
}

Add cron deletion workers and RabbitMQ cleanup queue

Add ghost chat DB collection with:
{
 encrypted_payload,
 session_key,
 expire_at
}

Enable biometric access + secret PIN

All screens must animate self-destruct and ghost UI visual effects

Must scale to:
- millions of messages
- heavy load
- multiple concurrent encrypted sessions
- users online at same time

Must work with realtime updates
Must remain fast even with bigger data
